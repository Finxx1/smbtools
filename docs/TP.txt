Shouldn't need to know any more about TP files:

4 bytes - file count

per file:
  4 bytes - offset in archive
  4 bytes - file size
  9 bytes - useless (I think)

after header:
  per file:
    N bytes - file data

tid-bits:
+ .DAT files seem to be a modification of this format, adding a listing of file paths.
