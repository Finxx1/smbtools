What we know about .AM files so far:

there are two types of AM files, signed ones and unsigned ones
signed ones have the 4-byte signature at the start, among other extra data that
unsigned files don't.

general layout:
file header
string table
series of symbol list entries

signed header:
char[4] - ascii "101F" or "001F"
uint16 - len of string table
uint32 - symbol count
uint16 - 0xF0 0x41
uint32 - ftex count

unsigned header:
uint16 - len of string table
uint32 - symbol count
uint16 - 0xF0 0x41

symbol list entry:
uint32 - [1]
float32 - ignored
float32 - ignored
uint32[] - unknown (one uint32 per layer)
layer[] - series of layers

[1]: number of layers, shifted left once, ANDed with a bit that determines if it loops or not.

layer:
uint32 - unknown (zero)
uint32 - keyframe count
float32 - duration of symbol timeline in seconds
char[12] - 0xFF x12 (signed files only)
keyframe[] - series of keyframes (56 bytes big)

keyframe:
uint32 - texture id
float32 - x position
float32 - y position
float32 - x scale
float32 - y scale
float32 - x skew
float32 - y skew
float32 - x offset
float32 - y offset
rgba - color tinting
uint32 - unknown (zero)

rgba:
int16 - red value
int16 - red intensity
int16 - green value
int16 - green intensity
int16 - blue value
int16 - blue intensity
int16 - alpha value
int16 - alpha intensity

tid-bits:
+ AM indexes clips (or symbols) and uses the index in the file, so swapping names around DOES change the symbol it refers to.
+ If a type is specified for an unknown, it was probably found through Ghidra, or because of sensible values throughout several test files.
