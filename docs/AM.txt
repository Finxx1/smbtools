What we know about .AM files so far:

4 bytes - ascii "101F"
2 bytes - len of symbol listing
4 bytes - symbol count
2 bytes - 0xF0 0x41
4 bytes - frames (I think)
null-delimited array of ascii strings

tid-bits:
+ AM indexes clips (or symbols) and uses the index in the file, so swapping names around DOES change the symbol it refers to.
